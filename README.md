# IEngine
The goal of this project is to create a simple reusable 2D IOS engine. 

This includes
Graphics
Audio
Distance/Intersection Tests
Vector and Matrix Libraries
Game State Management
Math and Random Number Libraries

Right now everything is written in Objective C except the Vector/Matrix code
which is plain C.
