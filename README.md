# BlankIphoneGame
This will be an empty iphone game project that includes graphics, physics,
sound and state management.

For now the only objective c code is the interface with the OS.  This 
includes sound, the AppDelegate and GameViewController.  Everything else
is in C++.  Eventually I plan on moving everything to objective C.
